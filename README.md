# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:

The purpose of the new analysis is well defined. (3 pt)
	
This challenge is to analyze the ride sharing data by city and present our observations to V.Isualize, the CEO of Pyber. During the analysis, we merge the 2 datasets, city and ride data, and get insights into how Pyber performs in the city types. The first task is to get ride sharing summary by city type and the second task is to use various methods like pivot and loc to zoom in on specific information, in this case, data from 1st January through 29th April of 2019. Then display the ride sharing summary in a plot.


## Results:

### Deliverable 1:

Created a dataframe summarizing ride-sharing data among the different city types. Ride-sharing data include the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type.

Here is the ride-sharing summary by city type:

### Deliverable 2:

Used methods from pandas and matplotlib libraries to format data, pivot into soecific datarange using the pivot and loc methods, and finally get weekly summary by fare between January 1 and April 2019 for all the city types

## Summary:

Overall, based on the ride sharing summary, Urban cities have more rides and drivers than rural cities. Rurl cities got less rides and average fare per ride is more in rural cities than urban. The recommendation to the CEO is to focus on Tier 2 and 3 cities to encourage people to use ride share apps. This can be done by implementing pool options or increasing the number of drivers in these cities that offer these services.
